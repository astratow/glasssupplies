			<h3>Leaded</h3> 
			<p>The many colours and designs that can be produced means leading is a creative option for windows, doors, cabinets, in both interior and exterior locations. The malleability property of the self adhesive lead makes it possible for beautiful and intricate designs to be produced.</p>
			<p>
			We currently use two types of lead Natural and Antique. Natural lead has no coating and will oxidise over time. This results in the weathered look of traditional old leaded windows. The Antique lead however is coated so they are weather resistant and will retain their appearance for many years.</p>
			<p>We offer these leads in both oval and flat, in 6mm, 9mm, 12mm and 15mm on request.</p>
			</li>

			<h3>Bevelled</h3>
			<p>We offer a wide range of bevels designs which are both intricate and elegant. The bevel designs are manufactured out of 5mm float with the edges bevelled down to 1.5mm – 1.8mm. The complex and striking designs are available in clear and green, blue, bronze and grey tints.</p>
			</li>

			<h3>Georgian</h3>
			<p>Georgian bar windows remain popular and can give a traditional and elegant look to windows and doors. We manufacture our Georgian patterns in 18mm, 25mm and 45mm on request. </p>

			<h3>Duplex Spacers</h3>
