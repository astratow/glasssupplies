We offer acoustic glass in 6.4 mm , 8.8mm and 12.8mm. When acoustic glass is used in a sealed unit the acoustic glass will dampen noise vibrations and therefore cuts down noise pollution.

Acoustic glass also have the safety and security features of Laminate. This means when the product is broken it is retained in the frame by the PVB interlayer giving increased security in comparison to toughened.
