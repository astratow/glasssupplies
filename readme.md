# GlassSupplies website project
I am making a website for my current employer.

I found previous site in web achieve and copied most of the content,
 but now I try to design it responsively and in modern fashion.

I created basic structure, I need to work on navigation and responsiveness of it.

I am asking client if we should go for free hosting and use of the template.
