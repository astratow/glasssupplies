The many colours and designs that can be produced means leading is a creative option for windows, doors, cabinets, in both interior and exterior locations. The malleability property of the self adhesive lead makes it possible for beautiful and intricate designs to be produced.

We currently use two types of lead Natural and Antique. Natural lead has no coating and will oxidise over time. This results in the weathered look of traditional old leaded windows. The Antique lead however is coated so they are weather resistant and will retain their appearance for many years.

We offer these leads in both oval and flat, in 6mm, 9mm, 12mm and 15mm on request.
